WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   RAM/GND_8_o_offset[2]_AND_77_o is sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not
   good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of data into the
   flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   RAM/GND_8_o_offset[3]_AND_75_o is sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not
   good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of data into the
   flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   RAM/GND_8_o_offset[4]_AND_73_o is sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not
   good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of data into the
   flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   RAM/GND_8_o_offset[5]_AND_71_o is sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not
   good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of data into the
   flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   RAM/GND_8_o_offset[6]_AND_69_o is sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not
   good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of data into the
   flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   RAM/GND_8_o_offset[7]_AND_67_o is sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not
   good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of data into the
   flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   RAM/GND_8_o_offset[0]_AND_81_o is sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not
   good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of data into the
   flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   RAM/GND_8_o_offset[1]_AND_79_o is sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not
   good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of data into the
   flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:2410 - This design is using one or more 9K Block RAMs
   (RAMB8BWER).  9K Block RAM initialization data, both user defined and
   default, may be incorrect and should not be used.  For more information,
   please reference Xilinx Answer Record 39999.
DRC detected 0 errors and 9 warnings.  Please see the previously displayed
individual error or warning messages for more details.
